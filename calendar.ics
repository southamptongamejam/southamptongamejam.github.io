DESCRIPTION:Go and play each other's games!\n\nVoting sheets will be ava
 ilable from the organisers. Go get one and mark off the games you've pla
 yed. Try to play them all!\n\nWe'll likely be coming around with cameras
  at this point so if you're comfortable being on camera - it'd be great 
 if you could demo your game for us and give a little interview.
